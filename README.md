Emergency Safety App
The objective of this application is to get information from police officer at incident spot via 
app and send notification to the registered customerâ€™s app in form of push notification. 
Police control room will play as a bridge between fetching information from police officer 
and making ready to broadcast messages from a central server of control room
/// Implementation Details/// 
In this project based on smartwatch application I have created a User Story mapping to prioritize the actions 
for each process step according to the importance for this application. To provide a better overview, several requirements have been depicted in 
UML Diagrams.
After the completion of requirement analysis, I will step towards modelling Unified 
Modelling Language (UML). Among a large variety of diagrams,i have focused on the 
following UML Diagrams:

o Use case diagram 
o Activity diagram 
o Sequence diagram
o Class Diagram (Entire system)

For graphical representation, I have used Magic Systems of Systems Architect 2021x . 
For the visualization of user interface, I have used User Interface prototype Model. Balsamiq Wireframes for Desktop is used in this project to design the user interface for this application.
